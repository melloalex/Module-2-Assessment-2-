                                  <h3>LIQUORCITY</h3>
    <p>Having been in Liquor Retail for a number of years, Liquor City’s founder and chief Manuel De Atouguia decided a radical change was required, not only in the way liquor stores looked but in the manner their customers were treated. He set about building a brand which asked the question “What do South Africans want”.

At a time when very little variety was available he ventured into other continents and discovered brands which he felt met with the desires of the South African people.

Liquor City imported, and continue to import, brands which offer tremendous value to the South African consumer. Brands which are recognised internationally as being the best. Brands with multiple international awards. Brands which aren’t readily available across South Africa and more importantly Brands with great pricing. With a philosophy which includes responsible liquor retailing Liquor City continue to grow all over South Africa and value the relationships built up with our customers, suppliers and staff. Thank you for your support over our first 21 years and we look forward to serving you for many more.</p>
